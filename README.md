This repository will be used to store scripts made for leaning Python as well as scripts created for the purpose of automation.

Script Name | Purpose
--- | ---
ise_report_analysis | This script has been created to automate a report generated on a daily basis from the Cisco ISE appliance. By automating the creation of the report it will save a considerable amount of man hours spent performing a repetitive process. The purpose of the report is to highlight authentication failures for devices on the network as identified by Cisco ISE, with the intention of remediating legitimate failing devices and recording statistics.
